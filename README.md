# LoginTracker
A work-in-progress Python/Google Sheets sign-in/sign-out system

Keep in mind: this is VERY work-in-progress. Expect stuff to be broken.

~~For a quick (but relatively controversial) way of installing everything but the service_account.json file, use `curl -sSL https://github.com/cj-plusplus/LoginTracker/install.sh | bash`~~ TODO - fix or create

Small portions of the Python were done by ChatGPT. I (@TaigaM123) am not sure how much time or effort it saved though.
